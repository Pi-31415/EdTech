# EdTech Web Development Front Page

>If you have any questions about the code, please contact the original developer Pi at https://github.com/Pi-31415 on Github, or https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEWFzdFCW_I7nipJgA on Telegram.

I will be using the following tools for this single-page design.

## Locally hosted

* HTML 5
* SASS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Slick

## via CDN
* Google Fonts (Kodchasan,Aldrich,Bungee Hairline)
* Google Material Icons
* Font Awesome

To compile sass to css, first install SASS via NPM

```
npm install -g sass
```

Then, locate to source folder and please run

```
cd css
sass style.sass style.css
```

## Venn Diagram
The order of rotation is in the global array
```
var venn_id_global = ['venn-academics', 'venn-interest', 'venn-portfolio'];
```

## List of Stock Images Used

* Hero Banner (from unsplash)
* Person holding pen (https://unsplash.com/photos/O3gOgPB4sRU)
* Avatars of people

## Todo list

* Edit schedule(), logout() and login() functions in js/app.js when the backend API is available
* Reduce the file size for the stock images before use.

>Further documentation in detail is written where necessary in the source files.
